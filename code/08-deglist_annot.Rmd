Rmd to annotate the DEGlists from Experiments A and B from Summer 2021 Sea Star Wasting Disease Challenge Experiments. DEG lists will be annotated with the _Pycnopodia helianthoides_ genome gene list FASTA BLAST results, uniprot, GO, and the gene counts from the libraries. 

Where the files live that will be used to annotate:    
1. _P. helianthoides_ genome gene list FASTA BLAST output: `/analyses/06-BLAST/summer2021-uniprot_blastx.tab`
2. DEG lists:      
Experiment A -->     `/analyses/05-deseq2/expA_DEGlist_armdrop-exposed_v_healthy-control.tab`
Experiment B -->     `/analyses/05-deseq2/expB_DEGlist_control_v_exposed.tab`
3. `kallisto` gene counts: `/data/kallisto_count_matrix_rounded.tab`
4. uniprot SP GO --> 

Order of operations for each DEG list:       
1.
