Rmd to annotate the DEGlists from Experiments A and B from Summer 2021 Sea Star Wasting Disease Challenge Experiments. DEG lists will be annotated with the _Pycnopodia helianthoides_ genome gene list FASTA BLAST results, uniprot, GO, and the gene counts from the libraries. 

Where the files live that will be used to annotate:    
1. _P. helianthoides_ genome gene list FASTA BLAST output:     


Order of operations for each DEG list:
